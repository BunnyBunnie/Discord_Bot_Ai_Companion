🧐 <b>About the Project</b><br>
The current landscape of Discord bots is vast, but most are utilitarian—designed for moderation, music, or simple utility tasks.<br>This project seeks to build a different kind of bot: an AI Companion. We want to leverage the latest advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) to create an entity that feels less like a script and more like a real person.

<b>Why are we building this?</b><br>


Exploration: To push the boundaries of conversational AI within the social context of a platform like Discord.

Community: To provide a tool that can facilitate interaction, offer a friendly "ear," or simply entertain with rich, dynamic dialogue.

Learning: To deepen our understanding of LLM integration, Discord API development, and scalable software architecture.
<br>
<br>
✨ <b>Key Features</b><br>

Real-time Conversation: Fast, responsive dialogue using modern streaming technology.

Natural Language Understanding: Capable of understanding complex sentence structures, idioms, and sarcasm.

Contextual Memory: The AI remembers past parts of the conversation, allowing for coherent, long-form discussions.

Persona Customization: (Planned) Ability for server administrators or users to define the "personality" of their companion.

Emotion Recognition: (Planned) The AI will adapt its tone based on the perceived emotional state of the user.
